The provided codes demonstrate the implementation of two machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM)—on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Both models aim to classify whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant based on various features of cell nuclei present in the dataset.
